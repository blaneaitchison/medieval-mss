The text establishes the qualities and natures of the planets and zodiac signs through which accidents are determined (in four chapters, fols. 92r-100v), followed by an electionary (101r-125v). It is split into seventeen parts with three-line blue lombardic capitols with red flourishes, occasionally accompanied by a rubric (see <q>Decoration</q>). The second part contains nine integrated tables and one full-page table (fol. 109r). The same hand as item 7 has numbered the paragraphs and tables from 1-29.

Each chapter thereafter opens with a similar three line blue lombard with red flourishes and a rubricated running title. Top line ascenders are occasionally flourished throughout the text.</decoNote>

                  <additions>Fol. 1r: a marginal inscription of the sixteenth century, faded, atesting to the origin of the text and its translator Guy of Valence, bishop of Tripolis. This same hand annotates this first item throughout, in Latin and English, with comments on the individuals named or the themes discussed. For instance, folio 2r on the role of John who translated the text into Arabic; and folio 23r on the wisdom of philosophers. Various <q>nota</q> annotations are also made throughout.
                     <p>The same hand annotates the explanatory text of item 2, with a note on the meridian of Oxford (fol. 68v); item 10, with a note on Aschenden's book (fol. 93r); item 11, with a note <q>de matromonius</q> (fol. 152v) and others; </p>
                  <p>An addition to item 2 is added at the end of the text, in a contemporary hand but different to the scribe (fol. 69r).</p>
                  <p>The blank folio 69v has been annotated in a sixteenth century humanist hand with a note in Latin on the astrological date and time of the birth of the son of Lord John Zowche on 10 December 1564.</p>
                  <p>A fifteenth century hand annotates item 11 with eleven notes, for instance to the <q>authour of this booke</q> (fol. 180r), <q>de maritis</q> (fol. 181r), and <q>who ther on shall be ryche or no</q> (fol. 181v). The same hand leaves one note in items 13 (fol. 191r) and 14 (fol. 193r-v), and throughout item 15.</p>
                     <p>Calculations are made in the margins of folios 53r, and on the stub after folio 103.</p>

                  <bindingDesc><binding notAfter="1692" notBefore="1617"><p>Late seventeenth-century calf binding over pasteboards, typical of Elias Ashmole's style. The edges of both boards are decorated with concentric tool framing. There are two clasps anchored to the upper board with three pins, on leather fore-edge flaps which are reinforced with parchment. Each clasp contains Ashmole's coat of arms. The facing catch plates are anchored to the lower board with three pins. The board edges are tooled with a repeating zig-zag pattern, also typical of Ashmole's bindings. The sewing supports are laced into the boards using shortened single-hole lacing without channels.</p>
                     <p>The spine shows five raised sewing supports covering thick cords, without end bands. The binding has been rebacked since entering the Bodleian's collection, and only the second spine panel (containing Ashmole's coat of arms with gold tooling around the margins) remains, now adhered to the spine covering in the same place. The spine is now covered in a separate piece of leather from the boards, of the same colour, that extends under the board-covers. The panels on the spine are decorated with the same style of concentric tool framing as the boards. The shelf mark <q>ASH. 396</q> is embossed on the third spine panel, in a typeset that is similar, but not identical, to Ashmole's typeset (varying in the height of letters and thickness of vertical strokes in characters <q>A</q> and <q>9</q>). The signature <q>W 2.2.57</q> is recorded on the inside of the lower board, likely the date of rebacking and initial of the bookbinder.</p> </binding></bindingDesc>

                  <provenance>The manuscript was in the possession of Sir John Zouche in the mid sixteenth century. The blank folio 69v has been annotated in a sixteenth century humanist hand with a note in Latin on the astrological date and time of the birth of the son of Lord John Zowche on 10 December 1564. This likely refers to <ref target="https://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1558-1603/member/zouche-john-1564-1610">John Zouche</ref> of Codnor, Derbyshire (1564-1610), who was Justice of the Peace for Derbyshire by 1594-5. He was the son of <ref target="https://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1509-1558/member/zouche-john-ii-1534-86">Sir John Zouche II</ref> of Codnor, Derbyshire (1534-86), likely the scribe of the inscription. The manuscript is not mentioned in his will of 1585 (TNA 	PROB 11/68/364). </provenance>
                  <provenance>The front flyleaf of the volume is a recycled parchment indenture dated 1608. It relates to a William Treng<gap reason="cancelled"></gap> of London and Robert Danvers, gentleman, and describes an agreement which has passed down from Danvers father, William Danvers. It relates to lands called Lavermore and Maidenheth in Cookham, Berkshire, and the Manor of Ives. (See Key, <ref target="https://archive.org/details/historyandantiq00kerrgoog/page/n141/mode/2up"><title>The history and antiquities of the hundred of Bray, in the county of Berks</title></ref>.) In volume 3 of his <title>Antiquities of Berkshire</title>, Elias Ashmole records that the estate of the manor of Ives includes these lands (p. 80, 1719) - this indenture is possibly his source for this information. It is unclear when this flyleaf was added to the volume, but it was certainly before 1692.</provenance>
                  <provenance>The manuscript was later owned by <persName key="person_27215170">Elias Ashmole</persName> (1617–1692), who is responsible for the current binding of the manuscript (subsequently repaired by the Bodleian). Ashmole collected astrological material, especially treatises with tables of lunar phases or relating to the zodiac, such as MS Ashmole 6, 8, 186, 188, 191, etc. This likely explains his reason for collecting MS Ashmole 396.</provenance>
                  <provenance>The manuscript was bequeathed to the Ashmolean Museum by <persName key="person_27215170">Elias Ashmole</persName> in 1692 as part of his donation of 1,100 printed books and 600 manuscripts.</provenance>
                  <acquisition>The manuscript was kept in the Ashmolean until 1860, when the collection was transferred to the Bodleian Library .</acquisition>
